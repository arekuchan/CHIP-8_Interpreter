Hi, I'm working on a Chip-8 emulator. This project isn't functional yet but thanks for stopping by. I'm just doing this to learn computer architecture and (modern) c++. As this is a personal project, I'm currently not accepting contributions, however, if you want to review my code, I'm all ears!

I'm using c++20, and are developing on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS on WSL 1.

Dependicies:
- Eigen 3
- Yaml-cpp
- SDL2

Having trouble with running the project on WSL? You probably need to install Xserver and configure enviornment variables for the emulator display window to work
